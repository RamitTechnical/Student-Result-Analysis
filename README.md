# Student-Result-Analysis
**Challenge:** Analyzing student data to unveil correlations for decision-making. 

**Action:** Using Python libraries for preprocessing and visualization.  

**Result:** Identifying relationships between parental education, activities, and academic performance.


**Description**:

The Student Report Analysis project demonstrates my proficiency in data analysis and visualization using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. This project involves in-depth exploration of student performance data, including gender distribution, parent education impact, ethnic group distribution, and more. Through various analytical tasks and visualization techniques, I uncover valuable insights to inform decision-making in educational settings.

**Key Highlights**:

•	Conducted comprehensive analysis of gender distribution and its impact on academic performance.

•	Explored the relationship between parent education levels and student scores across different courses.

•	Investigated the influence of parent marital status on student performance metrics.

•	Utilized data visualization techniques such as boxplots, pie charts, and heatmaps to present insights effectively.

•	Identified outliers and trends in student performance data, providing actionable recommendations for improvement.
